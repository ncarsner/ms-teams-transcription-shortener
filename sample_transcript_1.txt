We we understand that bypass bypass file is to load a word open orders and you know close ordered history for a short period of time.
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.930
Client RepA
But while we were reviewing that bypass file and the audit types.
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:23.910
Client RepA
Uh, we we. We were wondering, you know how we would load our open?
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:44.030
Client RepA
Ah, allocations that you know the the money that has come in and we have we have allocations, but it's its not associated with any audits. How do we load that? We don't. We don't need to talk talk about it today, but you know that is something which we would like to, you know.
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.610
Client RepA
We'll talk to you all when you know when we when we are ready to talk about it.
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.470

These field names with values you can create an audit for those situations. RepA, if you have the required information we need to create an audit.
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:25.480
Client RepA
OK OK, uh RepB, but the the voluntary money that we get back, do they always result in an order it or you know in our current system? Or sometimes they do not?
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:38.680
Client RepA
Probably this is something that we need to take back and talk, you know, do all of our open voucher deducts. Sorry the voluntary refunds that we received. Do they all end up in an audit?
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.280
Client RepB
Yeah.
